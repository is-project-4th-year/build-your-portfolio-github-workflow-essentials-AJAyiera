## 3. Learnings from the Git Crash Program

**ðŸ§  What I Thought I'd Learn vs What I Actually Learned**
**1. Concept: Branching**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I never thought branching was important and everything could be done on the main brand.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Branching is the most important feature in team development

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I learnt to work with branches to avoid interfering with my teammates work and to document changes

**2. Concept: Merging**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I never needed to merge since I was always on the main branch.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Merging allows for updating the main branch with only the wanted changes that are ready to be integrated.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I can now display what is only necessary and ready for the project.

**3. Concept: Issue and Milestones**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I thought these features would not be useful for solo developers.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: They help track changes and branches allowing for progress tracking over time.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I can structure my work and time better with clear goals for each step of the way.

**4. Concept: Documentation**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I would havve learnt how to use md. files.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: Documentation has a lot of important instructions for the potential users and clients.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I can now create detailed documentation pages for my projects on GitHub.

**5. Concept: Deploying Pages**

`Expectation ðŸ‘€` : I did not know this was possible.

`Reality ðŸ˜…`: GitHub can simulate pages that I create, providing a way to preview and launch sites.

`Impact ðŸ’¡`: I can now deploy pages when ready through the repository settings.
